## [unreleased]
- chore(research): evaluated OpenWhispr, HeadAudio, HeadTTS for reuse against diagen's Discord voice + browser VRM demo pipelines; no wholesale replacement is warranted. Findings: (1) OpenWhispr is a monolithic Electron desktop app (React 19 + native whisper.cpp/sherpa-onnx bindings) with no standalone Node module — diagen's existing `discord-whisper.js` (`@huggingface/transformers` v4, in-process, no native binding) is already simpler and more portable, so no STT change. (2) HeadAudio (MIT, `@met4citizen/headaudio`) is a real, portable browser AudioWorklet doing live MFCC+Gaussian 15-viseme classification — but `animation-core.mjs` + `facial-player.mjs` already drive `gh-pages-src/demo`'s Cleetus.vrm from a pre-baked 52-ARKit-blendshape `.afan` animation (produced by the `audio2afan`/`LipsyncSDKNode` neural pipeline), which is strictly higher fidelity than HeadAudio's live classifier — not adopted. (3) HeadTTS (MIT) uses Kokoro-82M (StyleTTS2), a different model family from LuxTTS's ZipVoice-distill 4-step flow-matching sampler, so no model-level reuse; its `misakiToOculusViseme` IPA-phoneme-to-viseme lookup table is genuinely portable code (IPA-keyed, not Kokoro-specific) but would be a fidelity downgrade vs. the waveform-driven `audio2afan` pipeline diagen's `/api/generate` already runs on LuxTTS output — not adopted. No source changes; existing STT/TTS/lip-sync stack retained as-is.
- feat(tts): replace Chatterbox with F5-TTS (nsarang/voice-cloning-f5-tts). Server bridge `f5-tts-bridge.js` runs the vendored `f5-core/` (nsarang src/core, adapted for Node) over onnxruntime-node using the 3 self-contained ONNX models from `nsarang/F5-TTS-ONNX` (encoder/transformer/decoder bundle mel + flow-matching + vocoder). Char-level tokenizer (no espeak), raw-audio reference at runtime (no pre-encode), 24kHz output. Verified end-to-end (tools/test-f5-node.mjs PASS). Browser demo worker `gh-pages-src/demo/tts-worker.js` runs the same core over onnxruntime-web (WebGPU/WASM), models loaded from HF. Callsites (`server.js`, `speak-gate.js`) repointed; Chatterbox bridge + speaker-embedding tooling removed; `tools/download-f5-models.mjs` fetches the models (gitignored, ~1.4GB). Server runs the fp32 transformer on onnxruntime-node's webgpu EP (~20s for 5.4s audio, 6.6x faster than CPU's 131s; CPU fallback for GPU-less machines, F5_EP override). fp16 is unusable server-side (onnxruntime-node's native binding rejects Float16Array inputs) and dml falls back per-node for fp32, so fp32+webgpu is the path; the browser uses fp16 on WebGPU.
- feat(tts): pre-encode speaker tensors into voices/<name>.embedding.bin + .embedding.json sidecar. New tools/encode-speakers.mjs produces them; chatterbox-tts-bridge.js setRefVoice loads cached tensors directly when present (skipping speech_encoder roundtrip). New CI workflow encode-voices.yml regenerates embeddings on voices/*.wav change.
- feat(browser): rewrite gh-pages-src/demo/tts-worker.js against @huggingface/transformers directly — drops streamtts dependency. Worker fetches voices/<name>.embedding.bin + .embedding.json from gh-pages, deserializes 4 tensors (audio_features, audio_tokens, speaker_embeddings, speaker_features), passes them to model.generate(). Eliminates runtime encode_speech call (~5-15s per voice load saved).
- chore(pages): pages.yml copies voices/*.embedding.bin and *.embedding.json into gh-pages-src/demo/voices/ alongside WAVs.
- feat(browser): drop local Chatterbox TTS implementation — demo/tts-worker.js is now a thin wrapper over `streamtts@latest` (loaded from esm.sh), calling `ChatterboxSDK.configure({ modelBasePath })` pointed at `raw.githubusercontent.com/AnEntrypoint/streamtts/models/`. The streamtts package ships the SDK + worker + chunk-reassembly fetch interceptor; diagen no longer maintains its own copy.
- chore(ci): remove Chatterbox model download + chunking step from pages.yml. The model lives on streamtts's `models` branch (rebuilt on HF upstream change by build-model.yml there); diagen's gh-pages deploy is now a small orphan commit of just the demo + landing markup.
- fix(ci): pages.yml deploy step now publishes gh-pages-src as an orphan branch with force-push. Prior approach checked out main's gh-pages, overlaid files, and pushed — this leaked server source files into the branch and hit non-fast-forward rejections when runs raced.
- fix(pages): vendor design-system fonts (Archivo, Archivo Narrow, JetBrains Mono, Space Grotesk) to gh-pages-src/design/vendor/fonts/ + fonts.css; link from both index.html and demo/index.html so ff-display / ff-mono resolve to real webfonts instead of falling back to Times New Roman on the landing page.
- fix(ci): pages.yml snapshot_download now uses allow_patterns to fetch only q4 (wasm) + q4f16 (webgpu) ONNX variants. Prior full snapshot was ~4.3GB and caused git push HTTP 500 during gh-pages deploy. Chunker walks the onnx/ dir for any *.onnx_data > 99MB (no longer hardcoded to fixed filenames, so variant-suffixed files are handled automatically).
- feat(pages): migrate gh-pages-src to design system — sync colors_and_type.css + app-shell.css from c:/dev/design; both index.html and demo/index.html now use .app/.app-topbar/.app-main/.app-status shell; drop var(--border) (incompatible with border:0 reset); update tts receipt entry to chatterbox turbo
- feat(ci): pages.yml downloads ResembleAI/chatterbox-turbo-ONNX at build time via huggingface_hub; splits 3 oversized .onnx_data files (155-175MB) into ≤99MB .part* chunks; writes chunks.json manifest. Browser demo loads models locally with no CDN dependency at runtime.
- feat(browser): tts-worker.js sets env.localModelPath + env.allowRemoteModels=false; fetch interceptor reads chunks.json and reassembles .part* chunks transparently before ONNX runtime sees the data
- feat: replace Qwen3-TTS Python bridge with Chatterbox Turbo (ResembleAI/chatterbox-turbo-ONNX) via @huggingface/transformers v4 — no Python subprocess, Node.js-native ONNX inference. New chatterbox-tts-bridge.js: pre-encodes speaker WAV once at setRefVoice(), synthesize/synthesizeStream API matches old bridge contract. speak-gate.js and server.js updated.
- feat(browser): replace Pocket TTS WASM worker with Chatterbox Turbo WebGPU/WASM worker — @huggingface/transformers v4 from CDN, voice cloning from voices/*.wav, streams audio_chunk messages per sentence chunk, same app-tts.js protocol
- fix: whisper-stream.js isSentinel() now filters parenthesized sentinel outputs like "(upbeat music)" alongside [...] and *...* patterns. Prevents sentinel annotations from triggering speak-gate state transitions.
- feat: replace utterance-triggered processTranscript with 5-state speak-gate machine (LISTENING/WAITING/GATING/ANSWERING/SPEAKING). Whisper words debounce 1s into a grammar-constrained YES/NO gating LLM call; YES fires the answering LLM then streams TTS. Any whisper during a post-LISTENING stage aborts back to WAITING. Bot history written only when at least one TTS chunk played.
- new: speak-gate.js (188L, dispatch-table state transitions, per-stage AbortController, env-tunable timeouts)
- chore: discord-vad.js rewritten — RMS-gates whisper feed at pushFrame (dispipe has no unsubscribe), drops handleUtterance/processTranscript/preamble/speculative/interruption-resume plumbing
- chore: discord-voice-processor.js shrunk to 67L — config-only, forwards setVoiceEmbedding/setCharacterCard to speak-gate
- new: llm-llamacpp.js exposes buildGrammar() so consumers share the model's llama instance (mismatched instances throw)
- new: GET /debug/speak-gate observability endpoint
- feat: swap Pocket TTS for Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B via faster-qwen3-tts (CUDA-graph streaming, ~700-850ms first chunk, ~1.3x RT warm)
- new: qwen3-tts-bridge.js + qwen3_tts_server.py (Node↔Python subprocess, identical synthesize/synthesizeStream contract to prior bridges)
- chore: delete pocket-tts-bridge.js, pocket_tts_server.py, omnivoice-tts-bridge.js, omnivoice_tts_server.py
- fix: on voice close code 4017, force gateway shard reconnect (recover=0) to get fresh session_id instead of waiting 10s with stale session
